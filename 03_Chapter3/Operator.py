a = 10
b = 2

# Arithamatic operator


print(a + b)  # adding a and b. Output: 6
print(a - b)  # subtracting a and b. Output: 2
print(a * b)  # multiplying a and b. Output: 8
print(a / b)  # dividing a and b. Output: 2.0
print(a % b)  # It return the reminder. Output: 0
print(a ** b) # It multiply 4 2 times like square. Output: 16


#Comparison operator

# This operator  are use to compare the two operand

print(a==b)   # Both operand value is same then return True else false
print(a<b)    # a is less than b then return True else false
print(a>b)    # a is greater than b then return True else false
print(a<=b)   # a is less than and equal to b then return True else false
print(a>=b)   # a is greater than and equal to b then return True else false
print(a!=b)   # a is not equal to b then return True else false


#Assignment operator

# This operator are used to assign the value to the variable

c = a # the right hand side value are assign to the left side value means  value of a is assign to the variable c
print(c)

#Logical operator 

print(a>b and a<b)  #both condition is true then return true else false. Output: Flase
print(a>b or a<b)   #from both condition one of them is true  then return true else false. Output: True
print(not(a>b))     #if condition is true then return false and if condition is false then return true. Output: False
